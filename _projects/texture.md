Tactile perception for texture and object characterization
----------------------------------------------------------

Robots capable of classifying objects and textures will provide early insights when interacting with their environment.
There is a large area of application of such robots, from garbage selection to domestic tasks, capable of characterization.

During this project, I and some master students performed experiments using two types of multi-modal tactile sensors [^1].

Using inertial measurements and pressure, information from tactile sensor trained machine learning models to classify textures and sets of objects.
