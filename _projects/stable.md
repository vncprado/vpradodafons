Autonomous stable grasping
--------------------------

This project aims to improve robotic object grasping.
Grasping stability in unstructured environments can be challenging.
Robots that operate in those settings will require reliable grasping.

Applying Fuzzy logic to grasping control has improved several aspects of object manipulation. For instance, we incorporate semi-autonomous teleoperation on other projects [^1].

Identifying objects during the early phases of robotic grasping will enable the next generation of robots to fast update on finger and wrist positions. This will require a stable grasp of unknown objects.
