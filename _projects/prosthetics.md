Tactile-enabled Control of Human-like and Prostetic Hands
---------------------------------------------------------

The main goal of this project is to develop Machine Learning methods that enable the production of intelligent prostheses. Electric prosthesis rejection rates are 23% in adults and 32% in children, and in a recent study, 89% of users felt they were more efficient without the prosthesis, which is a frequent reason for avoiding prosthesis use. A significant limitation is that current devices require the user to pay extra attention when manipulating objects due to the missing sense of touch. Our research focuses on developing touch-enabled human-like hands and collected visual, tactile and muscle data from healthy individuals during tasks in laboratory environments. Some recent publications involve the study of tactile and visual response of individuals[^1], improving control[^2] and teleoperation[^3] of human-like hands.

<!-- This project also involves teleoperated human-robot interaction for in-hand manipulation, such as demonstrated in the following video.
