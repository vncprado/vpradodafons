Machine learning and tactile sensing applied to dexterous manipulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dexterous manipulation is a crucial ability for the next generation of robots.
On this project, a robotic hand equipped with multi-modal tactile sensors provided perception information used to train machine learning models[^1].
This setup was able to provide insights into robotic in-hand object characterization.

This project also involves teleoperated human-robot interaction for in-hand manipulation, such as demonstrated in the following video.
