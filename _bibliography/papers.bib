abstract = {This paper presents a novel vision-based hand gesture recognition (HGR) and training system for a human-like robot hand. We implemented and trained a multiclass-SVM classifier and N-Dimensional DTW (ND-DTW) classifier for static posture recognition and dynamic gesture recognition. Training features were extracted from the raw gestures depth data captured by Leap Motion Controller. The experimental results show that multiclass SVM method has an average 98.25% recognition rates and the shortest run time when compared to k-NN and ANBC. For dynamic gestures, ND-DTW classifier displays a better performance than DHMM with an average 95.5% recognition rate and significantly shorter run time. In conclusion, the combination of SVMs and DTW proves the efficiency and high accuracy in proposed human-robot interaction system.},

abstract = {A new generation of humanoid robots is emerging to work together with, or even replace, human operators performing complex dextrous manipulation operations in a variety of applications such as health and elder care, hazardous or high-risk environments, telemedicine, or manufacturing. To meet the challenging operational requirements of such applications, this new generation of humanoid robots should not only look as humans, but should also behave like them, being able to sense and perceive the external world and perform tasks as humans do. Touch sensing and perception is essential when handling objects while working on such complex activities in unstructured environments. The major challenges encountered when replicating the human touch sensing mechanisms are due to the inherently low resolution of the tactile images produced by the artificial sensors, to the complexity of interpreting the sensor data, and to the fact that robot hand technology is still clumsy when compared with the nimble dexterity of the human hand and fingers. This paper presents practical touch sensing solutions for humanoid robots (Fig. 1) that mimic the complex sensing mechanisms occurring in a human hand while exploring by touch 3D objects.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Use of underactuated fingers to conduct precision, in-hand manipulation is a common topic of recent robotics research, mostly due to their relatively light weight and simplicity of use. Grasping operations are facilitated by compliant joints however precise, in-hand manipulation is more challenging since post-grasp orientation of an object varies. Underactuated, robotic-fingered hands that are capable of predictable grasping are one step closer to human-like end-effectors. This paper presents a new effort towards effective robotic manipulation using two underactuated fingers and one fully actuated robotic thumb with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). Fuzzy grasping using tactile feedback is used to provide an enhanced stable grasp solution. The system comprises tactile feedback, orientation of underactuated phalanges using flexible joints, and thumb trajectory planning.},

abstract = {Underactuated hands are useful tools for robotic in-hand manipulation tasks due to their capability to seamlessly adapt to unknown objects. To enable robots using such hands to achieve and maintain stable grasping conditions even under external disturbances while keeping track of an in-hand object's state requires learning object-tactile sensing data relationships. The human somatosensory system combines visual and tactile sensing information in their ‚ÄúWhat and Where‚Äù subsystem to achieve high levels of manipulation skills. The present paper proposes an approach for estimating the pose of in-hand objects combining tactile sensing data and visual frames of reference like the human ‚ÄúWhat and Where‚Äù subsystem. The system proposed here uses machine learning methods to estimate the orientation of in-hand objects from the data gathered by tactile sensors mounted on the phalanges of underactuated fingers. While tactile sensing provides local information about objects during in-hand manipulation, a vision system generates egocentric and allocentric frames of reference. A dual fuzzy logic controller was developed to achieve and sustain stable grasping conditions autonomously while forces were applied to in-hand objects to expose the system to different object configurations. Two sets of experiments were used to explore the system capabilities. On the first set, external forces changed the orientation of objects while the fuzzy controller kept objects in-hand for tactile and visual data collection for five machine learning estimators. Among these estimators, the ridge regressor achieved an average mean squared error of 0.077 ‚àò . On the second set of experiments, one of the underactuated fingers performed open-loop object rotations and data recorded were supplied to the same set of estimators. In this scenario, the Multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network achieved the lowest mean squared error of 0.067 ‚àò .},

Synthetic perception of textures was achieved using a recently developed miniaturized multi-modal tactile sensor. Thirteen commonly used textures were dynamically explored and classified using supervised learning classifiers. The best result was achieved by the Extra Trees classifier with an average accuracy score of 95%. Other classifiers also had high-performance results with an average accuracy score of 92% (Random Forest), 91% (Support-Vector Machines), and 88% (Multilayer Perceptron). Among pressure, acceleration and magnetic flux, the sensor‚Äôs angular velocity proved to be the most efficient feature to classify textures. The results also showed a correct classification between two textures that were originated from the same anisotropic material. This indicated that the exploration in different directions produced distinctive outputs and, therefore, the exploration in two dimensions have to be analyzed in future works.},
